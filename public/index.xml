      <description>Background and Purpose In honor of the week of Juneteenth, this week’s #TidyTuesday data contains information about the history of African-American slavery 1. Juneteenth (June 19th) is a holiday commemorating the day that a small subset of enslaved people in Texas, one of the last groups to hear the news, heard that they had been freed by the Emancipation Proclamation. Although freedom came little by little to different regions of the nation at different times and was not official until the 13th amendment was passed in December of 1965, the local blacks of the area in Texas decided on June 19th as their day of celebration, and the holiday gradually came to be recognized across the country 2.</description>

      <description>1
Marble racing has become a recent trend. It involves dropping marbles into a track, and the marble that stays in the track the longest wins. When the marble goes into the track, it swirls around a structure shaped like a funnel, and then eventually drops through the hole of the funnel into another funnel and repeats the process through a series of funnels until it falls all the way out of the track.</description>

Creating cocktails is a delicate art. This week’s #TidyTuesday data contains recipe information for many different types of cocktails including the ingredients and amounts of each ingredient in each drink 2 3.
I used this data to examine the top 5 ingredients by frequency (how many different recipes the ingredient appears in) and amount (total volume of ingredient in ounces across all recipes) for each of 8 different categories of cocktails.</description>

Volcanic eruptions are incredible geological phenomena, but they can also cause significant damage to the environment and surrounding populations. According to wikipedia, a volcanic eruption occurs when a crack in Earth’s crust allows hot lava, volcanic ash, and gases to escape from below the surface 2.
This week the #TidyTuesday data includes information about volcanic eruptions over time including the names of the volcanos, the dates of all eruptions between 11345 B.</description>

      <description>One of my goals for the summer is to practice my R skills using data provided by the R for Data Science Tidy Tuesday Project 1.
